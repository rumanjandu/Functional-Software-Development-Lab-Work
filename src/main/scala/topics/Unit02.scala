   * There are some important points to note about this method definition:
   * 1. Notice the use of the type BigInt. This type represents unbounded integers which cannot overflow.
   *    They are built on top of Java's BigInteger type but look a lot prettier in Scala. Because the
   *    Fibonacci sequence generates very big numbers very quickly it is useful to use the BigInt data
   *    type in this instance.
   * 2. The method fibonacci is NOT recursive. It deals with the initial cases of the zero-th and first
   *    Fibonacci numnbers. However, for the nth Fibonacci number (where n>1), a call is made to an
   *    auxialliary method called loop.
   * 3. The auxilliary method uses recursion and takes three parameters. The first two parameters carry
   *    the previous two values in the sequence. This is why, when it is called initally from fibonacci,
   *    the initial values of a and b are 0 and 1 respectively. The third parameter is a counter
   *    representing which Fibonacci number is required. Initially it is the value originally requested.
   *    However, with each recursive call it is reduced by one until it reaches the base value of zero.
   * 4. The reason for coding the method using an auxilliary is because we do not want to clutter up
   *    the main fibonacci method with parameters carrying the previous two values. This is really
   *    internal information that the client does not want to see. Therefore, the main method only
   *    takes as input the index, n, that the client wishes to provide. The auxilliary method then does
   *    the bulk of the work.
   * Let us trace an evaluation to see how it works:
   *
   *    fibonacci(8)
   *  = loop(0,1,8)
   *  = loop(1,1,7)
   *  = loop(1,2,6)
   *  = loop(2,3,5)
   *  = loop(3,5,4)
   *  = loop(5,8,3)
   *  = loop(8,13,2)
   *  = 8+13
   *  = 21
